      <i>Updated 6/28/2019</i> 
      <p>This tutorial explains how to use the Microsoft Visual Studio 
        Debugger to debug 32-bit assembly language programs running in protected 
        mode. Specifically, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Step through your program, viewing the source code</li>
        <li>Set breakpoints in your code</li>
        <li>View CPU registers and flags</li>
        <li>View a disassembly of your program</li>
        <li>Watch the values of program variables</li>
        <li>View the runtime stack</li>
        <li>Display blocks of memory </li>
      </ul>
	    <p>
		    For additional information about 
		    debugging in Visual Studio, visit <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/">
		    http://msdn.microsoft.com</a> and search for <i>Debugging in Visual Studio</i>.</p>
        <p>
		    <a href="http://www.asmirvine.com/debug/vstudio2019/index.htm#errors">Select this link</a> if you're having trouble getting the debugger to recognize 
            debugging information.</p>
	    <h3>Configure Visual Studio for Debugging</h3>
	    <p>Visual Studio has a set of different configurations that make it easy to create a 
		    variety of project types (Visual Basic, ASP.NET, etc.). In order to get the most 
		    out of debugging assembly language programs, you need to select an appropriate 
		    configuration. From the Tools menu in Visual Studio, select I<i>mport and Export Settings</i>. 
				(In Visual Studio Express, select <em>Settings</em> from the Tools menu, then 
				select <em>Import and Export Settings</em>.)</p>
			<p>In the following 
		    dialog, select <i>Reset all settings </i>and click the <i>Next </i>button<i>. </i></p>
	    <p>
		    <img alt="Import/Export Settings Wizard" src="./Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Debugger_files/s1.gif" style="width: 617px; height: 549px"></p>
	    <p>In the next pane, you have the option of saving your current settings. This would 
		    be useful if you want to return to your current settings later. Select an option 
		    and click the <i>Next</i> button.</p>
	    <p>
		    <img alt="Save current settings window" src="./Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Debugger_files/s2.gif" style="width: 617px; height: 549px"></p>
	    <p>In the following pane (from Visual Studio Professional), select the Visual C++ settings and click the 
				<em>Finish</em> button.</p>
	    <p>
		    <img src="./Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Debugger_files/s3.gif" style="width: 617px; height: 549px"></p>
			<p>
        </p><p>Once your settings have been reset, click the <em>Close</em> button to close the wizard. </p>
	    <p>Once you begin working with the debugger, you can fine-tune the arrangement of the 
		    Visual Studio menus and windows, and save your specific settings for later 
		    recall.</p>
      <h3>Open a Visual Studio Project file </h3>
      <p>In this step-by-step tutorial, you will open the sample project and insert 
        an example program named AddTwo.asm.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to the <b>Examples\Project32</b> folder in the disk directory 
          that contains the book's sample programs. Ordinarily, the full path 
          will be c:\Irvine\Examples\Project32. </li>
		 <li>Double-click the file named <b>Project.sln</b>. </li>
		 <li>In The Solution Explorer window, right-click any existing files with an extension 
			 of .asm and select <b>Remove</b>. 
          When prompted by a dialog window, click the <b>Remove</b> button.</li>
		 <li>Right-click Project in the same window, select <b>Add</b>, and select 
          <b>Existing Item</b>.</li>
		 <li>Browse back one level to the Examples folder, then forward to the \ch03 folder,
		 and select the file named <b>AddTwo.asm</b>. 
			 It will be added to the Solution Explorer window.</li>
		 <li>Select <b>Save</b> All from the <b>File</b> menu to save your project 
          settings.</li>
		 <li>Double-click the AddTwo.asm filename in Solution Explorer to open 
          it in the editor:</li>
      </ol>
<pre>; AddTwo.asm - adds two 32-bit integers.
; Chapter 3 example

.386
.model flat,stdcall
.stack 4096
ExitProcess proto,dwExitCode:dword

.code
main proc
	mov	eax,5				
	add	eax,6				

	invoke ExitProcess,0
main endp
end main		
</pre>
      <p>Build the project by selecting <b>Build Solution</b> from the <b>Build</b> 
        menu. In the output window, you should see text similar to that shown below. Extra 
		 lines may be added:</p>
	    <pre>1&gt;_MASM: 
1&gt; Assembling [Inputs]... 
1&gt;Link: 
1&gt; Project.vcxproj -&gt; C:\Irvine\Examples\Project32\Debug\Project.exe 
1&gt;Build succeeded. 
1&gt; 
1&gt;Time Elapsed 00:00:04.38 
========== Build: 1 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped ========== 
</pre>
	    
The important thing to notice is the last line, which indicates that the build operation succeeded.	    
  
	   
<h3>Start the Debugger</h3>

	    Press the <b>F10 key</b> to start the debugger. Your environment should appear 
	    like this:<p><img src="./Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Debugger_files/S4.gif" height="400"> </p>
      <p>Don't worry if some of the windows shown here do not appear on your screen. 
        You can open and close them at will. First however, let's take a tour:</p>
      <h4>Source Window</h4>
      <p>The <b>Source</b> window displays the program's source file. Note that 
        the first <b>MOV</b> statement has a yellow arrow next to it. The arrow 
        always indicates the next statement that's about to execute.</p>
      <table width="90%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" bordercolorlight="#0000FF" bordercolordark="#3333FF">
        <tbody><tr> 
          <td><i>Tip:</i> You can remove any debugger window by right-clicking 
            on its Tab and selecting <b>Hide</b>. You can open any debugging window 
            by selecting <b>Windows</b> from the <b>Debug</b> menu. You can make a window 
			collapse when it is not used by clicking the Auto Hide icon in its title bar. 
			The icon looks like a push pin. If the pin points sideways, the window will 
			collapse automatically.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody></table>
<h3>Adjust the Debugging Support Windows</h3>
	    This is a good time to remove panels that you will not use. In the lower part of 
	    the debugger window, select an remove all but the Watch and Output panels. On 
	    the side panel, remove all but the Solution Explorer window. Also, from the 
	    Debug menu, select Windows, and select Registers. 
	    <p>
	    You may want to remove some of the extra toolbars from the top of the window. If 
	    so, select Toolbars from the View menu, and un-check any toolbars you want to 
	    remove. You can also remove individual buttons from a toolbar: Select the 
	    dropdown arrow on the right side of the toolbar, and select <i>Add or Remove 
	    Buttons</i>.<br>
	    
    </p><h4>Moving and Undocking Windows</h4>
	    You can move any window by dragging its titlebar with the mouse. You can 
	    dock it (position it) by dropping it on any side of your workspace. For example, 
	    I like to put the Registers and Watch windows on the right side of the work 
	    area. If, however, you have more than one window positioned directly on top of each 
	    other, dragging the title bar will move all windows at once. If you want to 
	    select only one window from a cluster of windows, drag its tab (on the bottom) 
	    to the new location. The other windows in the cluster will not be affected.
	    <p>
	    You can undock a window by dragging it with the mouse to any location on your 
	    desktop. It can be completely outside the Visual Studio window.

</p><h4>Watch Window</h4>
	   For this part of the tutorial, you will need two download the AddSub2.asm program
		by <a href="http://www.asmirvine.com/debug/vstudio2019/AddSub2.asm">right-clicking this link</a>. After downloading the file, 
		please add it to your Solution Explorer window, and remove the AddTwo.asm program.
		Here is a partial program listing:
<pre>		
INCLUDE Irvine32.inc
.data
val1     dword  10000h
val2     dword  40000h
val3     dword  20000h
finalVal dword  ?
.code
main PROC
	mov	eax,val1		; start with 10000h
	add	eax,val2		; add 40000h
	sub	eax,val3		; subtract 20000h
	mov	finalVal,eax		; store the result (30000h)
	call	DumpRegs		; display the registers
	exit
main ENDP
END main			
</pre>		
      If at some later time the watch window disappears, you can get it back again. 
		 While currently debugging a program, select <i>Windows</i> from the Debug menu, and select 
		 <i>Watch 1.</i> 
        A Watch window is like an electronic spreadsheet that displays the names 
        and values of selected variables. As you step through a program, you can 
        see variables in this window change value. Currently the window is empty, 
        but you can drag any program variable into the window with your mouse. 
      <p></p>
      <p>Next, you will display the value of some variables in the Watch window. Drag the <b>val1</b>, <b>val2</b>, 
		 <b>val3,</b> and <b>finalVal</b> 
           variables into the Watch window and note their current values: </p>
      <p>
		 <img alt="" src="./Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Debugger_files/s7.gif" height="176"></p>
      <p>The values are currently displayed in decimal, so select hexadecimal format by right-clicking on the watch window and selecting <b>Hexadecimal Display</b> from the 
        popup menu. Following is a sample:</p>
	    <p>
		 <img alt="" src="./Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Debugger_files/s8.gif" height="176"></p>
      <h4>Memory Window</h4>
      <p>From the Debug menu, welect <i>Windows, s</i>elect <i>Memory, </i>and select<i> 
          Memory 1</i>. 
        The Memory1 window displays a raw dump of memory in either hexadecimal 
        or decimal. It is particularly useful when working with array variables. 
        Since we don't have any arrays in the program, let's display the value 
        of <b>val3</b>. Next to the Address label, type: <b>&amp;val3</b></p>
      <p>The &amp; before the variable name means to interpret the variable name 
        as an address. In assembly language, all labels are implied addresses. 
        Variable names are case-sensitive in the debugger. The Memory window displays a series of individual memory bytes, beginning 
        at the address of <b>val3</b>. Right-click on the window, and select <i>4-byte 
        Integer</i> as the display format. Along the left side of the window is shown the address of 
        the first value in each line:</p>
      <p><img src="./Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Debugger_files/S9.gif" width="511" height="111"></p>
      <p>In our sample, <b>val3</b> is located at address 00405008, although your 
        addresses might be different. You can also type a hexadecmal constant 
        into the Address field. Use the C-language format, where the digits are 
        preceded by "0x". For example: 0x0040400C.</p>
        <p>Note: The memory Windows are only available if address-level debugging is enabled 
            in the Tools / Options / Debugging settings, available by clicking on the Tools 
            menu in Visual Studio, and then selecting Options. </p>

		<h4>Register Window</h4>
      <p>You can display the Register window by selecting <i>Windows</i> from the Debug menu, and selecting
		 <i>Register</i>. 
        The Register window displays the contents of the CPU registers. The flag 
        values do not show by default, but you can add them in by right-clicking 
        and selecting <i>Flags:</i></p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody></table>
      <h4> Disassembly Window</h4>
      <p>Select <i>Windows</i> from the Debug menu, and select <i>Disassembly</i>. The 
		 Disassembly window displays a raw listing of the program's code. In some 
		 programs, it will show code generated by macros or by high-level MASM directives 
		 (such as .IF, in Chapter 6). </p>
      <p><img src="./Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Debugger_files/S11.gif" height="528"></p>
      <p>If you right-click inside the Disassembly window, the popup context menu offers different viewing 
		 options:</p>
        <p>
            <img alt="" src="./Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Debugger_files/s18.gif"></p>
	    <p>Here is a sample in which <i>Show Source Code </i>is disabled, and both <i>Show 
		    address </i>and <i>Show 
        	 symbol names</i> options are enabled:</p>
      <pre>--- AddSub2.asm ----------------------------------------------------------------<br>main:<br>00401010  mov         eax,dword ptr [val1 (405000h)] <br>00401015  add         eax,dword ptr [val2 (405004h)] <br>0040101B  sub         eax,dword ptr [val3 (405008h)] <br>00401021  mov         dword ptr [finalVal (40500Ch)],eax <br>00401026  call        DumpRegs (4011F5h) <br>0040102B  push        0    <br>0040102D  call        ExitProcess (401D30h) 
		</pre>
		
      <p>The offset of each variable apears next to its name. The <b>exit</b> 
        statement in the source code listing has been translated into a call to 
        the MS-Windows <b>ExitProcess</b> function, which terminates the current program.</p>
      <h3>Steping Through the Program's Execution</h3>
      <p>Next, you will begin stepping through the program's execution, one line at a time. 
		 Press the F10 several times and watch the yellow arrow in the Source window move from statement 
        to statement. Notice the following as you step through the program:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Individual register names (in the <i>Register</i> window) turn red, 
          indicating that they have been modified. The AddSub2 program modifies 
          the EAX and EIP registers quite a bit, as you can see.</li>
        <li>Variables in the Watch window turn red when they are modified.</li>
        <li>Memory locations in the Memory window turn red when they are modified.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As soon as you step past the <b>call DumpRegs</b> statement, click on the black 
		 MS-DOS icon on the Taskbar at the bottom of the screen. You should see the 
		 program's output, which is a register display:</p>
	    <p>
		    <img src="./Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Debugger_files/s13.gif" style="width: 597px; height: 153px"></p>
      <p>When you reach the <b>exit</b> statement and press F10, the debugger halts and you 
		 return to editing mode. </p>
      <h4>Step Into Command (F11)</h4>
      <p>Another way to step through a program is to use the <b>Step Into</b> (F11) 
        command. It steps down into procedure calls. In contrast, the F10 key 
        just executes procedure calls without tracing into the procedure code.</p>
<h3>Stopping and Restarting</h3>
      <p>It's easy to either stop or restart your program inside the debugger 
        while you're in the process of stepping through a program:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To restart the program, select <i>Restart</i> from the Debug menu. 
          The program is reloaded into memory, so any changes previously made 
          to variables in the Watch window are undone. Also, you have to retype 
          the name of your variable in the Memory window, because it resets itself 
          to a default address.</li>
        <li>To stop debugging in the middle of a program, select <i>Stop Debugging</i> 
          from the Debug menu. You can also use the icon containing a small square on the 
		   Debug toolbar.</li>
      </ul>
<h4>Toggle Breakpoint (F9)</h4>
		    You can set a breakpoint on any executable line in your source program by either 
	    clicking the mouse in the left margin, or pressing the F9 key. This can 
		    be done before you start the debugger, or while you are stepping through the 
		    program. If you press F9 when the cursor is on a line containing a 
	    breakpoint, the breakpoint is removed. The following image shows code containing 
	    a breakpoint:<br>
	    <br>
	    <img border="1" src="./Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Debugger_files/s15.gif" style="width: 437px; height: 193px"><br>
	    <br>
	    	    When you set a breakpoint, you can run your program at full speed up to 
		    the line containing the first breakpoint. The debugger will pause on the line, 
		    and wait for you to either step through the code from that point, or run the 
		    program to the next breakpoint.<ul>
		    <li>Use the F5 key (Menu: Debug / Run) to start a program and run to the first 
		    breakpoint.</li>
		    <li>When at a breakpoint, use the F5 key (Menu: Debug/Continue) to continue 
		    execution to the next breakpoint.</li>
	    </ul>
         <table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="style1">
		    <tbody><tr>
			    <td class="style2">
				    <i><b>Tip:</b></i> Be sure to stop the debugger before trying to modify and re-assemble 
        your program's source code. Otherwise, the linker will refuse to assemble 
        your EXE file, indicating that it's currently in use</td>
		    </tr>
	    </tbody></table>
<h3>Viewing the Runtime Stack</h3>
	    <p>The runtime stack will become more important as you beginn to write programs that 
		    contain procedures other than main. Each time you call a procedure, you place 
		    the program's return address on the stack. (This is explained in Chapter 5.) To 
		    view the runtime stack while debugging, display a memory window at the 
		    address specified in the ESP register. In the following image, the stack shows a 
		    return address (00401025) stored at the memory location point to by the ESP 
		    (stack pointer) register:</p>
	    <p>
		    <img src="./Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Debugger_files/s16.gif" style="width: 335px; height: 182px"></p>
	    <p>When you display the stack, right-click the memory window and select <i>4-byte Integer</i> as the display format.</p>
		 
<h3>Saving Your Visual Studio Setup</h3>
	    <p>After configuring Visual Studio to your debugging and editing preferences, you 
		    would be wise to save your setup. Here are the steps:</p>
			<ol>
			<li>From the Tools menu, select <i>Import and Export Settings</i>.</li>
			<li>In the next wizard step, select <i>Export selected environment settings</i>.</li>
			<li>In the next step, you select which settings to save. Leave the default 
		    selections unchanged.</li>
			<li>In the last panel, select a name that you're likely to remember for the 
		    settings file and click the <i>Finish</i>
